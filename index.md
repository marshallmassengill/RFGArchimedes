# Project Archimedes
This website contains information and resources for the Project Archimedes Proposal, a _Business Transformation_ project for the Redwood Financial Group.

## Three Core takeaways:
- Create value by unlocking innovation and responding to new opportunities
- Protect brand and customer trust at a time when threats are pervasive
- Engage the workforce with intuitive experiences that boost productivity

## Going forward, the high priority items are:
- Decision and approval of the presented approach
- Workshop series to gather requirements for the different parts of the business
- Workshop series to drive the discovery of the potential of the key areas _process_ and _people_.
- Checkpoint to assess MVP scope and timeline
